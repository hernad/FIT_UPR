b) void main varijanta

gcc prijavljuje:

z_1b.cpp:5: error: ‘::main’ must return ‘int’

razlog: void main nije u skladu sa ANSI C standardom

Zaključak:
    So, if you want your software to be portable, please make main return int. *It does matter*.

In trying to compile some old test Unix C programs... I was not able to compile the programs. 
After a while of tying to debug the programs that were of format:

    void main(int argc, char *argv[]) or

    void main(int argc, char *argv[])

*That's not legal according to the ANSI C standard; it also resulted in bad exit code if main() falls of it end.*
